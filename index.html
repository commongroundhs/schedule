            <h2>
                Kevin Sinusas's Module 10 Project:<br/>JavaScript-based Text Resizer
            </h2>
            <p>
                As directed, for this project, I used JavaScript and CSS to increase and decrease the font size of body text based on user interaction. 
                To achieve this, I first defined a number of CSS variables in my external stylesheet. 
                Specifically, I defined the following properties:
            </p>

<pre>
:root {
    --bodyText: 16px;
    --headingText: 20px;
    --biggerText: 18px;
    --smallerText: 14px;
}</pre>

            <p>
                These properties were then used to style the text on this page using CSS rules, like the following:
            </p>
    <pre>
p, pre {
    font-size: var(--bodyText);
}</pre>
            <p>
                Next, I created and linked an external linked JavaScript file to dynamically modify these variables based on user interaction. 
                My fully commented code was submitted as part of this assignment, which you can view directly to see the details of my implementation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, after the DOM finishes loading, I have the site run a function I created called "fontSizeButtons()" that adds functionality to the buttons at the top of this page.
                This function selects the buttons based on their class and then loops through them, detecting their assigned font size and storing it in a variable. 
                "On-click" functionality is added to each button to call another function, passing in the assigned/target font size.
            </p>
            <p>
                The triggered function, "changeBodyFont(targetSize)", that I created first temporarily stores the current values of the CSS variables for body and heading text. 
                It uses these to calculate how much the body font size will need to change to reach the target size.  
                It then changes the value of the CSS variable for body text to the target size. 
                It also changes the heading text size by the same, computed amount. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The complete details of my approach can be seen in the submitted, commented JavaScript code. 
                Here are quick example lines of my code used to get and to assign CSS variable values:
<pre>
const root = document.querySelector(':root');

const oldBodyText = 
  window.getComputedStyle(root).getPropertyValue('--bodyText').trim();

root.style.setProperty('--bodyText', targetSize);

</pre>

            </p>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
